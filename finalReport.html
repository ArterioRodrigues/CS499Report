              After a discussion with the other group members, I was given the role of designing the front end.  I was in charge of designing the layout 
             and the overall look of the webpage. The front was design to communicate with the back end and used the data stored there to make the webpage.
             React was chosen as the platform to host the front end because it one of the most popular and widely used for frontend development. 
             React provides a workflow to create components and pages that can all interact, and pass values called props and it also provides a variety 
             of libraries to use for our project. The responsibility of the front end also incorporated learning and using CSS to make the website “pretty”.
             CSS is a programing language used in tandem with html file to edit their component look, operation, and placement.
             
                The first thing I create was a QUIZ component using the react built in props variables to my advantage. The QUIZ component gets an array of 
              question form the backend and parses to create a display of option on the webpage. It stores the answers form the user and send it back to 
              the backend for the algorithm to create curated list of workouts for the user. This was the first test for react. I went on to create other 
              components such as the search, analytics, navbar, and suggestion components. Each provided a unique challenge to create for example the 
              navbar need a pop-up feature to show the pages that the website can display. I had to learn how to dynamically render components. 
              Some challenge I face was data transfer between components and page, design (using CSS wasn’t as easy as first taught), dynamic changes of 
              components for example the search as a drop menu.  Pages where next on the agenda, as a website needs webpages, we create at first an 
              overview and workout page. This was later changed to Login, Profile, Recommendations and Register page. Display data was one of the hardest 
              tasks because it was sent at a string to the front end, so I had to create a way to parse and neatly display the output for this I made the
              suggestion component.
              
                After creating components, we want to use my next task was using CSS to style the webpage. At this point the website looked like it was 
              created in the 90s, design and “prettiness” plays a big role in user experience, so I focused on making everything look associated and 
              pretty. I created a CSS file for all components and pages to individually style each.  To accomplish this, I had to learn about each element 
              and what attributes they have and how to changes them and what it affects.

                  At the start of the project me and my other group members drew up drafts of what our project would look like and what features would be in 
                it. Once the idea was finalized I was given the role of setting up the backend and my job was to make a server for the group to work with. 
                We chose to use Express, a web application framework based on Nodejs. This uses the javascript language and since we’re going to use React,
                a front end javascript library, Express is perfect to make the back end server with. To start, I need to first set up express by creating a
                port and some lines of code that lets me start a local server with the specified port. Once that is done I need to make several API calls 
                so that the front end can communicate with the backend and vice versa.    
                
                  The crux of the project is developing an algorithm that recommends users workouts based on their choices. Thus the front end needs to 
                communicate to the backend the choices of the user so the algorithm can be put to work. To make this happen I need to connect the algorithm,
                written in python, to the backend express server. Fortunately it was simple to call the python file containing the algorithm within the 
                express server file. The next step was to make an API that sends the front end data containing a test case of user choices to the server. 
                I created the test case choices in a basic front end React web app and made the request to the server. The API I made worked as the request
                made it into the server and the algorithm was able to use the front end request containing the test choices to make a list of recommendation
                s. I also made it so that once the algorithm made the list of user based recommendations, the API will send that list to the front end so 
                that it will be displayed to the user.
                
                  The next task I needed to complete was to connect the server with the database. The database we chose to use is pgadmin which is based on 
                postgreSQL. Express does have a tool that allows one to do postgreSQL queries within the back end and connect with pgadmin. So first I 
                needed to set up pgadmin and make a test table with dummy data. Once that is done I need to make sure I’m able to connect to the database
                by making a query request within the server that should make its way to the database. The outcome of the request is that the database would
                be able to recognize the query from the server and then do the query. In this test the query statement is simply a select * which gets all 
                the rows of a specific table. The database will then send the results to the server which is displayed in the server’s console logs. 
                Additionally to further test the connection with the database I made an API call that is able to take frontend data to the server which is
                then saved to the database through an insert query statement in the server. 

                  After connecting the database with the server and connecting the frontend to the backend there were no new features to make for the 
                 server beyond editing API calls for changes made by my other group members. My contribution then shifted to more of a support role where
                 I tested out the changes and code made to the project by my group members. I also begin to take up some frontend tasks, like for example 
                 creating a login and registration system for the project. The login system is able to authenticate the user through the server checking 
                 if it matches with data from the database. The registration system is able to save the inputted data into the database through the
                 server that is based on the API calls that I made.

          My main area of focus was writing the algorithm to generate the recommendations of exercises taken from the backend or given by the user. 
        I was the only person to work on the algorithm. First, I had to research popular recommendation systems and different tutorials to see 
        how they did make theirs. The general consciousness for a system that looked easy to use was using TF-IDF values for the different exercises. 
        I then had to do more research into TF-IDF values and how to implement it. It was not useful to get TF-IDF values for exercise names, so Karnendra 
        and I worked together to create a database of exercises with different attributes. I chose to use python as the language to write the algorithms 
        in because I was familiar with the language and it had a TF-IDF vectorizer library I can use. 
        
	        I first started to write in a python file not connected to any backend or frontend, I just had a csv file of the exercises. One of the constraints
        we found was that the algorithm created an n’th degree array. Our exercise table contains 77 exercises, the algorithm would create a 77 x 77 table
        every time it ran. I ran the algorithm on some sample data with hundreds of entries and it crashed my computer, so we had to have a limit of how 
        many exercises to have, but also have a variety of exercises to choose from. Another problem that came up was the difference of the results from 
        the  TF-IDF vectorizer and the results I wanted to have. It did not do what I wanted it to do when it came to categorical data, so I had to create
        functions that mimicked what the vectorize did. The function checked what the set values were given as parameters and returned a double value from 
        0 to 1.0 based on the weight I gave it. 
        
	      I also had to research and come up with different ways of just sending out the exercises based on user input. We then had a meeting to discuss how
        to utilize our base algorithm in different ways and provide more user feedback. Karnendra and I brought up the idea of giving users the chance to
        rate the workouts they’ve done and use that to give variety to the recommendations. We also came up with the idea to have templates of certain 
        types of workouts to give more structure to the recommendations. Having a seemingly random assortment of workouts would overwhelm new users, so we
        created templates based on different days of the week. 
        
	      The templates required a different algorithm that built on top of the basic one. I created an algorithm that made up a dummy exercise to be put 
        into the exercise table and use different preferences taken from the template and user preferences. The output of the algorithm gave different 
        exercises for each exercise for the day, but there were multiple exercises to choose from instead of having one exercise that the user might not 
        like. 
        
	        I was also the primary problem solver and organizer of the project. I helped out in different areas, such as the backend, the frontend, and the 
        integration of everything. For the backend, I cleaned up the data and added some more tables, such as the exercises the users have done and the 
        table of users and their preferences. I also created most of the api calls and the queries that connected the backend to the front end. 
        Terry worked on it with me on some parts and cleaned up my work, but I wrote most of the calls and routes. I helped to create the overall 
        structure of the frontend with Terry. 
        
	        One of the problems that came up was trying to help in other parts of the project while still focusing on the algorithms. Towards the end of the 
        project, the different components were at different stages, so I had to help get everything up to speed and I did not have time to keep improving
        the algorithms. This also created bottlenecks that stopped algorithm development.

        My contributions to the project had to do with the planning, research, and the database portion of the backend. During the planning phase of the
        project, approximately the first month, our group had different directions we wanted to go in. For example one member wanted an automated system 
        for drone charging, another member wanted a website/webapp component, and another wanted a game or blockchain. We ended up using a workout 
        recommender system. 
        
        The research I did revolved around how recommender systems worked generally, scientific approaches to programming workouts, and into database 
        design principles. This was the first time I worked on database, program design, or designing an app as a group. I worked on what data points 
        would be utilized by the algorithm, and the workout database itself. The workout database was built from the ground up, each row describing 
        attributes of a specific exercise.  This was difficult in the sense that there is no open source database of workouts that broke down each aspect 
        of a workout. I designed the database for the algorithm to utilize/consume the attributes and then suggest similar movements. The algorithm that 
        we chose would take these attributes, combine them with user constraints/demands and personalize exercises. Further I had to do research on which
        anatomy and physiology was used by each movement. 
        
        One of the problems I encountered with the exercise database was that it took time to make. The reason being that each movement had to be 
        researched individually, categorized by attributes, and then I had to decide what variations would be made. For example a movement's attributes 
        could consist of the muscles used, directionality of force vectors, what the movement's utility was, and the equipment type. 
        
        The next step was creating the portion of the database that would hold user data and the workouts themselves. At this time we knew that the user 
        would have to have their information, quiz results, and then workout information stored, and accessed. A problem I encountered was that the 
        algorithm was doing a text based evaluation and recommendation at the time. This was fine for me exercises that have similar names (front squat vs
        a back squat). But the algorithm could not choose a repetition or set scheme for the user. This was pretty complicated for an algorithm to 
        recommend as well. The best way I figured was to have preset templates, where the algorithm would suggest an exercise, but the rep and set scheme
        would directly correlate with the test results of the user. This created a bit of a miscommunication with Chris, where it seemed like suggesting
        that we have preset exercises. I also didn’t fully understand how the algorithm worked. We ended up towards the end, realizing that we had to have
        the different attributes utilized to make a recommendation, and so I decided templates would have to reflect this. 
        
        Each template has static rep ranges but variable movement patterns based on the programming research. We join them depending on user results, 
        and then the algorithm fills the recommended portion. The user makes the choice of the movement after the recommender. This then goes to the 
        backend. I also created the server in Postgres and wrote the tables in Postgres. The schemas and database normalizations were done with the help 
        of Professor Al-dhaheri.
