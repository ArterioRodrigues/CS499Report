        <div>Christopher Wu- Introduction and Platform Overview</div>
        <pre class="tab1">
                Since its creation nearly 50 years ago, the C programming language has been widely used for its portability, 
            efficiency, and relative ease of use compared to assembly languages. While developers have a lot of freedom while using 
            C, it contradicts modern programming practices, such as strong typing, encapsulation, or genericity. It also can cause 
            cybersecurity issues.  One of the main problems is the analysis of code after the code is written or compiled. 
            This leads to code analysis being hard to implement for C programs. It is very easy to write code that generates undefined 
            behavior in C, such as illegal memory access, silently corrupting memory, and reading uninitialized variables. Another 
            problem is that C allows direct access through casts and pointer arithmetic, to the sequence of bytes that contain the 
            concrete representation of an object in memory. This leads to more of a chance for memory corruption and unintended behavior. 
                
                To address some of these problems, Frama-C was created. It is a code analysis platform that verifies the content of C code 
            and makes sure everything runs the way it was intended to. It acknowledges that there is no single solution and technique to 
            access all the properties of C code. Many techniques are combined and used in tandem to cover all the needs for a software engineer. 
            Frama-C encourages uses of third-party plugins and includes open source releases so other developers can create and use their own 
            plugins. Frama-C is designed to be used by  software engineers who are not necessarily experts in formal methods. It automates as 
            much of the process as possible, and assesses the performances of the platform on real-world case studies. 
            
                Frama-C allows users to analyze a C program to better understand it, simplify it, and assess different properties about it. 
            Program properties can be explicitly expressed as annotations written in the formal specification language ACSL. They can be 
            validated by partial, dynamic verification or formally verified by rigorous, static verification.  It does this by building a framework 
            of different tools, provided as plug-ins, that work together. Frama-C 21-Scandium, the latest release of Frama-C, contains 27 plug-ins. 
            All the plugs-ins do various things including verification, providing specific functional properties, helping to understand the code, and 
            helping expand other plugins. The developers acknowledge, though, that there is no one perfect plugin to solve a problem for all programs. 
            Some tools and techniques are more efficient for certain programs or properties than others. Frama-C encourages collaborations between 
            plugins to strengthen already existing techniques, and the collaboration happens in 2 ways: sequential and parallel. Sequential collaboration 
            is  using the results of one analyzer as the input of another. One analyzer also can generate annotated C code that can be used by another 
            analyzer. Parallel collaboration involves several analyzers to verify program properties, with each analyzer verifying a subset of 
            properties.

        <div>Terry Phung- Core Platform Analyses</div>
        <pre>
                The basis of Frama-Câ€™s core platform analyses is based on four plugins: Eva, WP, E-ACSL and PathCrawler. Eva provides a 
            customizable and automatic analysis of C programs that searches for undefined behaviors. Undefined behaviors are things 
            like invalid memory accesses, signed integer overflows and invalid pointer comparisons. Through a technique called abstract 
            interpretation, Eva can approximate on a line by line basis if a line of code is a potential undefined behavior. The plugin then 
            outputs a list of potential undefined behaviors or as the plugin calls it, an alarm. While generally robust, Eva can output false 
            alarms so each alarm must be checked if it is an actual bug or a false alarm. The WP plugin allows the use of deductive verification, 
            a method to prove that functional properties of a program holds up in all cases. WP performs the deductive verification on a 
            function by function basis, proving them separately. How it works is that WP compiles the C code and then converts it into 
            mathematical theorems. The C code turned theorems are then passed into automated theorem provers or satisfiability modulo theories(SMT) 
            solvers to prove if the mathematical theorem is valid or not. The E-ACSL plugin is dedicated to runtime assertion checking, the process 
            of verifying the program at runtime. It verifies the program by inserting E-ACSL annotations into the C code program which then 
            checks the annotations during runtime. If the annotation check passes, then the program continues running normally without errors. 
            If the annotation check fails, then the program stops and gives a report to the user the reason for the annotation check failure. The 
            last plugin analysis that Frama C uses is PathCrawler. PathCrawler generates test cases for a C program whose functions are tested on a 
            one by one basis. The purpose of this is to measure the code coverage of a C program and to explore the results that come from those test 
            cases.

        <div> ACSL Specification Language - Karnendra Verma</div>
        <pre>
           
                The C programming language has been used for the better part of fifty years,the design choices of the past do not translate 
            directly to the modern paradigms and requirements of the modern world. Given the rise of cyberattacks and the need for 
            even small and medium sized companies to have some degree of cyber/data security, it is evident that robust analytic tools 
            are a practical step for the future.  Some of the issues with legacy C code were the use of NULL character terminating strings, 
            the use of uninhibited pointers, and division by zero flaws. Frama-C has implemented  checks to ensure that run-time errors 
            are minimized, within the context of other plugins. Assertions can be used to check whether a pointer (p*) is greater than 0. 
            This would take care of one common case of read/write security flaws. Unfortunately, this does not mean that the program will 
            behave as intended, and therefore the use of a function contract becomes practical. What this means is that we add some 
            additional precondition constraints to our code to guarantee a certain postcondition outcome. A cooking analogy would be 
            having our lunch meats and veggies portioned and separated (precondition) in order to make the actual hero easier and quicker 
            to assemble (postcondition). One of the ways this is accomplished is by using ints and other real types unbounded. This helps 
            mitigate the potential overflow errors from occurring. This is very important due to the nature of architecture-specific security 
            flaws. For example, NSO, developed a spyware that was used in political assassinations, and it worked with buffer overflows of 
            temporary memory. C and C++ are used widely in embedded systems and architecture and are prone to buffer overflows.
