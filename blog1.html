                When we create programs we want them to be responsive to users’ 
            actions this makes their experience more fluid and natural. Due to improvement 
            today with internet connectivity and a full warehouse-scale computing system, 
            this is possible today. But we still can encounter problems with latency which 
            make the user experience worse. There are various software 
            techniques that are vital to building a responsive large-scale web service. 
                
                The problem of latency is very challenging because it is hard to keep latency constant 
            for example you can have high latency episodes. For large online services, we need to 
            create a predictably responsive this referred to as “latency tail-tolerant”.  
            Tail-tolerant works by taking advantage of resources already deployed to achieve 
            fault-tolerance, resulting in low additional overhead. 
                
                To fix the problem the first we need to know is why latency variability 
            exists. Variability exists because of a shared resource, daemons, global resource sharing, 
            maintenance activities, queueing, power limits, garbage collection, energy management. 
            We will discuss 2 ways how we can deal with variability. The first is short-term solutions 
            which refer to breaking a requested service into smaller problems and having multiple machines 
            complete the request. The next is the long-term solutions which refer to having many partitions 
            than machines in a system that are assigned data which each partition is responsible for. 
            This also allows for partitions to offload jobs to other partitions if they become overloaded.
                
                Our blog will go more indepth into these two solutions to latency tail-tolerant. 
            Most of these solutions are used by several large companies like Google to make their 
            software fluid and user friendly. An example of which is the famous google search engine.

                One solution to the latency problem is by breaking the requested service into smaller 
            problems and having multiple machines complete those smaller requests. For example, a 
            request that takes 100 seconds to complete could be broken down into 100 parts and be 
            run on 100 machines simultaneously. This would reduce completion time from 100 seconds 
            to one second, but there are drawbacks with this. It would increase the chance for a 
            machine to stall or delay and delay the whole request. The more machines there are, the 
            higher the chance, but it would still be an improvement in time over running the request 
            on one machine.

                Some solutions are smaller and are more software and scheduling based. For example, 
            a solution is to differentiate between service classes and higher-level requests so 
            the higher level queues run more quickly instead of spending time to run background 
            older requests. Another small software solution is to time background services on 
            every machine to run at the same time so there are no unexpected delays while running 
            a high priority request.

	            Another popular solution is to run the same request on multiple machines and take 
            the result from the first machine that completes the request. This is called hedged 
            requests. Once the first result is sent, the rest of the machines cancel their requests 
            and move on to their next task. Another way to do this is to send the same request to 
            different machines when the original request is past the 95’th percentile latency. 
            Hedged requests sometimes run the same request multiple times, making redundancy a factor. 

                Tied requests build upon hedged requests by having the machines communicate status 
            requests to each other. Once one machine starts a request, it tells the other machines 
            and they immediately take the request out of the queue. There is a chance that different 
            machines are running the same request at the same time when the message is still being delivered. 
            One solution to this problem is having other machines be delayed about twice the amount of time it 
            takes to send a message before it starts handling the request. On average, tied requests will 
            reduce latency 16%  to 38% from no hedging. A different method from hedged and tied requests is to 
            check out all the queues and send the request to the machine with the least amount of queued 
            work. It is a possible solution but it is still worse than sending the same work to multiple 
            machines. The reasons are that load/work times can change between probing and sending the 
            request, estimating request time is not very reliable, and many requests can all load onto 
            the same machine, creating a backlog.

                When it comes to long term solutions to reduce latency variability caused by data load 
            imbalance and service-time variations, there are micro partitioning, selective replication 
            and latency induced probation. Many systems already partition their data in a way that each 
            partition in a machine has equal cost to partitions in other machines, with the goal of dividing 
            data to make it more manageable and improve query processing performance. In practice such 
            a method is insufficient to handle latency variability because the performance of each individual 
            machine is not consistent and a single data assignment outlier can induce a load imbalance on 
            one partition. Instead of one partition to one machine, companies like Google use micro partitioning 
            where there are much more partitions than machines in a system. They then utilize dynamic 
            data assignment to manage responsibility of each partition and to enforce load balance. 
            If a machine is close to being overloaded, then some of their work can be assigned to a 
            partition in an idle machine to prevent the overload and to maintain load balance. 
            Additionally, micro partitions also have a fail-safe method where if a machine in the system 
            fails, then other machines in the system can pick up their work to stop the loss of data. 
            Selective replication improves on the idea of micro partitioning by being able to predict 
            certain items that can cause load imbalances. Selective replication creates copies of these 
            items and then spreads them around to other machines. This leads to multiple machines being 
            able to service the item thus sharing the data load without having to move micro partitions 
            around the system. The other solution, latency induced probation, works similarly to micro partitioning 
            in that it monitors the performance of each system to see if it’s overloaded or not. 
            Instead of reassigning work from overloaded machines to less active machines, latency induced 
            probation excludes the overloaded machine from the system while maintaining a connection with 
            it. The system collects statistics on the excluded machine, waiting until their latency 
            problem dissipates so it can be included into the system again. While it might seem counterproductive 
            to kick out machines during data work, it actually improves latency during periods of high loads. 
            However, despite these short term and long term solution all we can do is minimize latency variability.

        <pre>
                It is evident that as complexity and data demands increase, the need for minimizing the 
            effects of latency increases concurrently . An apt analogy for the mechanism is the butterfly effect. 
            This is described by abutterfly flapping its wings across the earth and causing a tornado in 
            the Midwest over a certain time frame. Small hiccups can  increase latency significantly, similar 
            to the butterfly effect over the time dimension. In a similar vein, hiccups in modern data systems 
            can end up accruing cost in the form of higher latency, primarily due to the nature of resource 
            allocation and demand within modern day systems. Further there is a dilemma in which it is not 
            possible to practically eliminate it completely, there are currently only ways of minimizing it. 

                Some common approaches to minimization would be global resource sharing by different machines, 
            maintenance techniques such as data reconstruction, multilayer queuing and throttling of 
            individual machines. It seems that focusing on cost benefit will allow for higher levels of service 
            as well. The future of reduced latency will likely revolve on two aspects, first the hardware advances 
            themselves. Hardware will likely be much more efficient on a micro level, as well as fitting 
            within larger scaling systems. Data centers and data networks may find clever ways of making 
            optimizations that reduce the cost of hiccups, or outright circumvent them with newer methodologies. 
            Next generation technologies will also focus on the large scale tail end solutions, but the root of the 
            problems will always stem from the accumulation of hiccups and the butterfly effect from these 
            hiccups. The goal will be to simplify systems as much as possible. 

                A rather interesting point is that nature and biology has done something similar, our bodies for 
            example are very efficient on both the micro layer and macro layer. Hopefully we can do this 
            with our computing systems as well.
