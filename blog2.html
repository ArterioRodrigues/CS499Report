        <pre class="tab1">
                A RS is defined as a software tool and technique used to provide users with 
            suggestions for items they may wish to utilize. The RS has two main roles one on 
            behalf of the service provide (for example YouTube) and the user (your everyday John Doe).  
            The service provider wants to recommend items to increase its turnover whereas the user 
            wants to have an interactive tailored experience. If the provider utilizes the RS correctly 
            it can lead to increase in number or items sold/used, sell more diverse items; able to 
            recommend items the user didn’t know they needed, increase the user satisfaction and user 
            fidelity. The RS should recognize old users and the preferences in items and over time 
            become more refine for their tastes.

	            To accomplishes these goals for the service provider the RS need to accomplish some 
            of these tasks:  1) Find some good items: when a new user starts the RS should be able to suggest 
            a few good items. 2) Find all good items: Able to find everything the user will need . 3) 
            Annotation in context: Given an existing user it should recommend based on their history. 4) 
            Recommend a bundle: Instead of recommending one thing recommend a group of things like the 
            recommendation. There are a lot more task, for our project we will focus on find all good items, 
            recommend a bundle/sequence, find credible recommendation and just browsing.
            
	            RS main source of processing is data it needs various kinds of data in order to build a 
            recommendation. This Data is primarily about the items to suggest and the users who will 
            receive these recommendations.  Data used by the RS are of 3 kinds of items, users and transactions. 
            Items are the objects that are recommended, they can be characterized by their complexity and value. 
            For example, an item that was useful to the user gets a + will one that wasn’t gets a -.  Users as data 
            refers to the personality or goals of the user what they want or are looking for. Finally, theirs 
            transactions which refers to the interaction between user and the RS. For example if the users doesn’t 
            like a item, this is stored as a transaction data set.

                In order for the recommender system to do its task of identifying the most relevant item for the 
            user, the recommender must predict that an item is the closest to what the user wants. To predict the 
            most relatable item to what the user wants, the recommender system employs several techniques to determine 
            the most relevant item. The first of these techniques is a content-based algorithm that recommends items based 
            on what the user liked in the past. For example, if a user played and liked an action game in the past, then 
            the system would recommend an action game that’s similar feature wise. The second technique is a collaborative 
            filtering algorithm that doesn’t just recommend items based on the similarity of its features to an item 
            that a user used before, it recommends items based on the ratings of users with similar tastes too. Using the 
            example from the content based algorithm, collaborative filtering recommends a game that is similar feature 
            wise to a game a user played before and by the reviews of other users. The third technique is a demographic 
            algorithm where instead of recommending items based on the similarity of items and user reviews, the demographic 
            algorithm recommends items based on a demographic’s assumed preferences. For example, if a user is part of the 
            “children” demographic, the algorithm will recommend items that it deems appropriate to that demographic like 
            toys or E rated movies. The fourth technique is a knowledge-based algorithm that recommends an item based on the 
            explicit preferences of its users. For example, if the user inputted directly what they want, let's say a car that 
            cost around the $2000-5000 range, then the system will recommend items with that specific filter in mind. The fifth 
            technique is a community based algorithm that works similarly to a collaborative filtering algorithm but instead 
            of depending on anonymous user ratings it depends on the ratings of the user’s friends. The algorithm assumes that 
            the user will likely choose an item based on the recommendation of their friends. The last technique that the author 
            discussed is a hybrid recommender algorithm which takes a combination of features of all the techniques that was 
            discussed. This algorithm can vary, meaning a hybrid algorithm can have features from a demographic algorithm and a 
            content filtering algorithm or any mixture of techniques.

                Recommender systems(rs) are now mostly used commercially, and the different applications of a recommender  system 
            will affect the design of the system, its implementation, maintenance and enhancement. The first part of the design 
            to consider is the domain, or what context will the rs be used in. The developer should take into account the specifics 
            of the domain, the requirements, challenges, and limits before choosing which recommender algorithm to choose. A three 
            approach model that can be used is thinking about system users, the characteristics of the data, and the overall 
            application.  

                Another issue to think about while determining effectiveness of a recommender system is evaluating how accurate the system 
            is giving recommendations. In the design phase, the recommendations the algorithms give should be compared to real-world 
            data,like user interactions or ratings. When the system is launched, evaluation should be done again to make sure the output 
            is similar to what users want. The way to determine that is compare real users’ ratings with what the algorithms normally 
            output. If the results are very different, then different weights should be adjusted to make the data align.

                In a perfect world, recommender systems would only give the best options to users and they would accept it, but that 
            does not happen. The whole point of recommender systems is that the user is not informed enough to make a decision on their 
            own, but it also means that they are not informed to know what a good recommendation is. The effectiveness of a rs is not 
            just how good the recommendations are, but also how much trust the user has in the recommendations and how likely they are 
            to use it. The rs must inspire trust with a user with a variety of techniques: have logic that is transparent, show new 
            items, provide details about the recommended item, and give ways to refine the recommendations.

                Trust is built on two different fronts: trust in other users of the recommender, and trust in the system. One way to build 
            trust in the system is by leaning into the trust between users. For example, in social recommender systems, such as Facebook 
            and LinkedIn, users are more likely to trust the system if it recommends other users that they trust, such as coworkers or 
            friends. Some other ways to build trust with a user is transparency and scrutability. There should be an explanation of why 
            the system gave out the certain recommendations. For example, the system could say “item x was recommended because of 
            feature a and feature b” to show the user why the recommendations were chosen. One limitation of recommender systems is that 
            the algorithms run once and do not take into account the feedback given by the user. A solution to this problem is using 
            conversational rs. They are built on having an interactive process between the user and the system.

                Recommender Systems are multidisciplinary in nature; for example they draw from machine learning , information retrieval, 
            and user psychology. Machine learning and Data mining draw from AI concepts to efficiently perform tasks based on data, data 
            usage and constraints , as well as past user experiences. We can also use them to model and predict future performance within 
            certain paradigms. We construct these through various statistical models such as regressions. Keep in mind though, these 
            predictions are not 100 percent accurate, though they can have a high utility given a sufficiently accurate model. Recommender 
            Systems utilize machine learning and data mining techniques along with filtering, ranking, processed feature weighting, and 
            incorporation of weighted feature sets. A few examples of the data mining techniques Recommender Systems typically take advantage 
            of are data preprocessing methods such as sampling and dimensionality, support vector machines, as well as clustering K-means, 
            hierarchical clustering (top down bottom up), and association rule mining. Association rule mining  is a technique to define a 
            collection of items or variables between datasets. Two common algorithms are APRIORI and SETM .Common applications are for 
            categorizing abstract data as well as modeling emergent behaviors within the datasets. We may use this in our project to see 
            what types of workouts a user may like and try to link it to a group or subgroup of users. Both Recommender Systems and Information 
            Retrieval  face overlapping problems in regards to filtering and ranking. IR’s can oftentimes overlook individual needs and “unique 
            interests” as well as usefulness. Further, it is possible that as a feedback loop over time, we may end up with more sameness and less 
            diversity within a customer base, or even a population.

                When examining the future of Recommender Systems, we see a trend towards social gamification. When you visit a new restaurant and 
            Google, it will ask for a review, rating, and likely aggregate your preferences into a profile of “what you like” and what other people 
            like you like. This has real world consequences, and businesses today can thrive or die by these rankings and ratings. In theory, given 
            enough robustness a system would work 100% of the time in minimizing fake reviews or profiles , but there is money to be made. So much so 
            that even Amazon and other multi-billion or trillion dollar companies have not found ways to make their Reccomenders infallible to bots 
            that rate products favorably or write fake reviews. Privacy concerns are also ever present, many of the best and most profitable 
            Reccomenders use enormous data sets, and that means that data has to be collected, stored and organized in a way that makes Data Retrieval 
            quick and efficient. This exposes risk in terms of Cybersecurity and customer personal identifying data.
