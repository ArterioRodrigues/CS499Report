              For process level communication, there has to be a transmission control program, also called TCP, to handle the transmission and the acceptance 
             of messages. The TCP breaks up the messages into the maximum length of 8-bytes to reduce strain on the system. One of the biggest tasks the TCP 
             performs is the multiplexing and demultiplexing of segments. Multiplexing is when the TCP takes segments from different sources and creates packets 
             to send. The TCP must be able to reconstruct and deliver messages to the proper destination processes. 
             
              One of the problems that comes up is how does the TCP take these messages and convert them into segments that are sent into the right places. 
             There are two different cases that arises. The first case is that the position of the segments are ignored and that the byte stream is formed into
             segments that are sent to the same TCP. This increases efficiency and all the information is contained in one packet header. However, the reconstruction 
             into the packets needs to be exact or it will not be correct.The second case is to take the position the different segments are coming into the TCP in 
             as their destination. This requires every packet to have a process header. The second cases takes into account  potential interprocess interference.
             
              Having address ports be different sizes and formats would be a problem if the TCP is not built to handle that. This problem arises when there is 
             communication between different networks and ports. A port is a designator of a message stream associated with a process. Having a standard port and 
             addresses will solve the issue. Every packet passes through a gateway which determines the destination network ID to determine how to route the packet.

                It is important to note that transmissions are not always 100% reliable and sometimes the transmission needs to be retried for it to connect. 
               The case in which this happens is when the TCP sender has packet loss when it tries to connect with receivers. To know when to retry the transmission,
               the TCP sender waits for a reply/acknowledgement from the receiver and if it does not get any, it does a retransmission. Retransmission allows for a 
               way for TCPs to recover from network failures and to deal with the occasional overdemand of the network. A retransmission policy also needs a method 
               in which the receiver is able to detect duplicate retransmissions and to tell the difference between new transmissions and retransmissions. 
               This is done through manipulating and ensuring unique sequences are passed through so that each new transmission is identifiably unique while 
               making it easy to detect duplicate transmissions.

                Besides the possibility of unreliable transmissions, TCP can also have the problem of the sender and receiver performing differently. 
              For example, a TCP sender sends about 20 messages a second but the TCP receiver is only able to receive about 10 messages a second. 
              Since the TCP receiver is not able to fully take in the messages that’s being sent, it starts to queue up the sent messages. If the sender 
              does not stop sending messages though, eventually the receiver queue starts to become full and starts to “drop” the sent messages because 
              the receiver is way too overloaded. This is obviously an issue as dropped messages are permanently lost so there has to be a way to equalize 
              the performance of the sender and receiver. The TCP flow control is the solution to this problem, as it is able to control the flow of messages 
              from the sender to equalize the speed with the receiver. TCP flow control uses the principles of retransmission to achieve this. The TCP sender
              waits for acknowledgement from the receiver and if it does not receive it, it means the receiver is too slow to receive the messages, so the sender
              modifies their speed to be equal to that of the receiver.

             The creation of the internet , as it is known today, stems from philosophies of connectedness. Specifically, that connection is simply an interaction 
             or any association betweens two entities. One of the inspirations for the system were telephone systems, but these required manual address switching. 
             The adaptation to static switches was the implementation of interface message processors, which allowed connections to be open and accessible without
             the downsides. Today we call the device a router, and they have become ubiquitous in information exchange and networks. The main reason we have the 
             modern day internet is due to ARPANET and the desire to transfer information between intelligence agencies and national security.
